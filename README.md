# Game_v1
Early development game

# To do:
Check out Tiled do make new levels, Im assuming that the Tiled app generates the images needed as well as the csv files for where each level of the floor is (walkable pathing, obstacles, grass, enemies, player)

CSV for objects seems fucked for the object indexing and placement, inconsistent throughout the level, when make own levels make sure everything is alright
